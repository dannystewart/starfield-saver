## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] (2025-04-09)

### Changed

- Bumps application version to 0.6.0, making it officially better than 0.5.9 but not quite as cool as 1.0.0 yet.
- Adds MIT license and updates project metadata, legally allowing you to do almost anything with the code except blame the author when things go wrong.

### Removed

- Removes auto-update functionality, because we don't distribute EXEs anymore. That's just unsafe.
- Removes dsutil submodule, because it's ancient and we use [polykit](https://github.com/dannystewart/polykit) now.
