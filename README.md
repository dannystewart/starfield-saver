# Starfield Quicksave Backup

A utility to create backups of Starfield quicksave files. All credit to [Andazeus](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/223) for the original script.

Just run the script and it'll begin backing up quicksaves according to the configured variables at the top. It'll check for a Steam Cloud save path first, then fall back to Documents, then fall back to OneDrive.

The script supports any EXE with `Starfield` in the name, in case you've renamed your Starfield EXE to something else (e.g. if you're using SFSE as `Starfield.exe` so you can still launch it via Steam). Just make sure you keep `Starfield` in the name and it will still work.
